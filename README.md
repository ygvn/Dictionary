A Simple Dictionary / Notepad Application

Latest Version: v1.0

This is a simple dictionary application based on C# .NET 4 framework. You can also use this application as a notepad.
Instead of having too many separate notes or text files on your desktop, you can save and keep all of them in one data file.
Simply enter your text into the richtextbox and click on save button.
All data is encrypted with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) by using a default password.
You can also encrypt each entry with your own password.
This application has search-as-you-type feature. Search suggestions will appear as you type into the textbox.
